reviewer1 :

The paper under review mainly concerns numerical implementation of gradient–based hyperparameter optimization algorithms. In terms of various aspects such as datasets, modes selection criteria, the problem is analysed
numerically.
Overall, the paper under review seems interesting in the terms of comparison of various algorithms. Although its
content and the proposed topics are suitable for the Journal, the manuscript presents some drawbacks. Especially,
this concerns spelling, language, inaccurate choice or omission of mathematical symbols and so on. Some various
issues should be addressed and clarified before the publication of this paper.
Below some comments and suggestions can be found.

• Page 2, lines 29-31: The authors claim that ”The main theoretical impact of the paper ....” However, there is
no theoretical contribution of this paper. - убрал theoretical

Reviewer #2: The paper presents very interesting results on hyperparameter optimization. The proposed algorithms based on the gradient-basis approach are analysed and tested. The algorithms are implemented in the form of a toolbox in Python programming language and are of open access. Thepros and contras of the proposed algorithms are discussed.

On my opinion, the paper deserves to be published in the Annals of Operatins Research. But I  recommend the authors to test the English presentation of the paper from the point of grammar, use of the definite and indefinite articles, the order of the words in sentences.

Also, I suggest to be more carefull with the notations used in the paper. Thus,in section 2, "Problem statement" , it is not clear the construction of the object matrix $\bold X$ and the label vector $\bold y$ and their connectin with the elements of the dataset; it is not clear why the same letter, f, is used for the model and for the functions introduced in (2) and (3). 

The list of references should be presented in the same style. In reference [13], the title of the journal, as well as all other data, are missing. In reference[30], it is mentioned (dsc thesis) and PhD thesis. In reference [33], the year 2015 is mentioned three times in the same reference.
